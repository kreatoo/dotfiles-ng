# dotfiles-ng
My final dotfiles (I hope)
Uses Ansible.

# Setup
Install ansible by running `pip install ansible`.
Then run `scripts/setup-install`.
**Please note that you will have to run this every time you move the dotfiles-ng folder.**
After this you can reload by running `setup-reload` in a terminal.
